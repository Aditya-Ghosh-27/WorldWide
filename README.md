# WorldWise

WorldWise is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to provide users with a seamless experience for exploring various aspects of the world. This README file outlines the key technologies and components used in the project.

## Technologies Used

- React Router
- Context API
- memo
- useMemo
- useCallback

## Description

WorldWise leverages React Router for navigation, allowing users to move between different sections of the application without full-page reloads. The Context API is utilized for state management, providing a centralized location for managing global application state and facilitating communication between components.

To enhance performance, memoization techniques such as `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` are employed. These optimizations help to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve the overall responsiveness of the application.

4. Start the development server:
